# BudgetBuddy

💳 BudgetBuddy v1.0

BudgetBuddy is a simple and intuitive personal finance tracker built in Python.
Designed like a digital wallet, it helps you manage your money in real time — track income, expenses, and categories, all stored safely in CSV files for persistence.

This is Phase 1 (MVP) of the project: a wallet-style desktop app with light/dark mode, category-based expenses, and a transaction history log.

Instead of spreadsheets or cluttered finance apps, BudgetBuddy gives you a clean, wallet-inspired interface where you can:
